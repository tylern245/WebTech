		<h1>About Me/Bio</h1>
		<p>Hello there! My name is Tyler Nguyen and I am 22-year-old senior at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I am currently pursuing a B.A. in computer science! I was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 1, 1999. I lived in a household both of my parents, who were immigrants from Vietnam, and my sister, and we were a lower-middle class family. After about five years, my parents said the area was too cold and it was bad for my sister's asthma, so we moved to Houston, Texas where the weather we generally a lot warmer (or rather hot). Houston is where I grew up and lived most of my life.
		<br><br>
		I've always loved being around computers and technology in general, but I never thought about growing up to be in the technology field until my senior year of high school. Growing up, I went through some phases, including piano, soccer, basketball, and high school band. But those were activities I chose because of my parents, my friends, or as a requirement for school. I can't say I have a real passion for any of those things.on and my career path. Coming from a person who didn't grow up with a lot of money, the salary is also a good motivator. Starting out fresh into abstract conce
		<br><br>
		It wasn't until a friend of mine convinced me to take Intro to CS and AP Computer Science during my senior year. This is when I found my real passipts such as OOP, arrays, and recursion was a real struggle for me. Most of my classmates were younger than me and I hate to admit but I often asked my younger classmen (even freshman) for help with those concepts and individual projects. Despite that, along with getting subpar grades on projects and exams, I still found a lot of fun and satisfaction in the learning process. Upon starting community college and choosing a computer science major, this is where I truly started learning on my own and tackling homework assignments and projects by myself.
		<br><br>
		I recently moved from Houston to San Antonio about two and a half years ago ever since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in March 2020. It was later that year in the fall when I transferred and started attending UTSA. I plan to graduate next semester in Spring 2023. After I graduate, I aspire to become a software or web developer in the future!
